1)Opposing Stationary units that do not move at the end of their turns while being adjacent do not damage each other in the subsequent turns

(they should damage each other once per turn when they are adjacent to each other)

2)move options get cut off at the bottom of the screen, pic: http://screencloud.net/v/p3DW
  (it currently creates the dialogue box where you let go of your click)
  
3)Goal moving around a stationary enemy unit only causes damage once 

(should be every time the units are adjacent goal mover takes damage)
