Need to fix:
1)move options get cut off at the bottom of the screen, pic: http://screencloud.net/v/p3DW
  (it currently creates the dialogue box where you let go of your click) (partily fixed)

Things to Implement:
1) shorten time between cycles (appx 0.5 secs when no battles engaged, and add 0.25secs when damage is being done)
2) optimized unit placement (instead of manually imputting coordinates from terminal, should have a visual method ingame)
3)Movement mechanics, instead of having to press undo to fix a movement, should be able to just click the unit again and drag
  should also be click unit first to select it, and then drag path 2nd instead of just drag all in one go
    -can use mouse hover for pathing instead of drag if its more intuitive that way

To be added in "final" product:
1) bigger grid (at least 10x17 for <standard> 10-12 units on each side battle)

Planned features:
1) networking capabilities

Aesthetics features:
1) floating damage text
2) make the entire thing bigger (size of grids/units etc)
3) unit health bars and way of matching up units to their info bar
4) line or something to mark the middle of the grid/sides (to improve map readability)
5) damage animation (maybe flashing line or something)
6) smooth unit cycle transitions (rather than just disappear then reappear)
7) simple menu before game starts (like simple version of pvp.net, normal/ranked/stats/startgame
