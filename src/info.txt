Specs and Details

Unit Types:
____________________________________________________________________________________

	Cavalry/archers [one both or none]
		{
		-Cavalry moves fast, archers ranged
		
		Cavalry:
			(
			~2x Movement range (10 blocks)
			~Strong vs foot, strong vs archer, weak vs spear
			)

		Archers:
			(
			~Ranged, 2 options
				-Choose where to fire (small aoe, or just 1 tile) + medium movement (less than spear and footsoldier)
				-Attack anything in range, but can't attack on movement turn, can choose target priorities beforehand
			~Strong vs spear, medium damage vs foot, high damage on cavalry unless being attacked
			)
	}

	Spear Wield
		{
		~medium damage vs foot but less hp
		~strong vs cavalry
		~medium damage vs archer
		}
	
	Foot Soldier
		{
		~Strong vs Archer
		~medium damage vs spear, but more hp
		~Weak vs Cavalry
		~medium vs suicidal 
			(
			footsoldier does same amount of damage as vs spear, but takes more damage
			)
		}

	Glass Cannon Soldier [maybe]
		{
		~strong vs footsoldier
		~strong vs cavalry
		~Strong vs Archer
		~Weak vs Spear
		~Low hp
		}
		
Game Mechanics:
_____________________________________________________________________________________

	Planning Phase
		{
		Get 3 moves per planning phase, 30 seconds to plan <adjustable>
		Moves can be next turn moves, or delayed moves <So more than 2 moves can happen per turn>
		3 types of movement:
			(
			Interruptable vs goal vs safe goal <explained in execution phase>
			)
		To plan route either hold mouse down for specific path, or click end tile for shortest path
		}
	Execution Phase
		{
		Moves made in planning phase are executed
		If there is a unit at the destination of a movement, moving unit will stop on the last available square
			~will engage if enemy unit
			~will just stop if friendly unit
			~archer attack is cancelled if out of range
		}
	Pre-Planning phase
		{
		10 seconds to view map and take in the battlefield
		}

	
		

Movement Mechanics:
___________________________________________________________________________________

	General Movement Mechanics:
		{
		Special Instances and Exceptions:
			If two units want to move onto same tile at the same time:
				(
				-based on priorities (goal move = 3, safe goal = 2, interruptable = 1)
				-highest priority movement gets to reach the tile, other unit stops on tile right before
				-if both units have equal priority, they both stop on the tile right before, and the destination tile is empty
				-justification:
					(
					1) if two armies movement destination is the same they will assess the enemy before commiting
					2) higher urgency move order wants the end tile more so will ignore the general case
					3) for allies as well, would have to work out the problem with commander before making final decision
					)
				-if opposing units and one of them takes tile, standard battle mechanics apply (see battle mechanics)
				)
			If goal move ends on a tile adjacent to unit they just moved through
				(
				Check if any other enemies adjacent
				(
				if true,
					(
					goal move units attack the new adjacent enemy unit 
						(if more than one, will prioritize being <flanker>, RNG if no possibility of being <flanker>)
					)
				else
					(
					-original 2x damage to them, plus standard engage (so goal move net 3x damage, enemy unit 1x damage)
					-this should also take into consideration multipliers <see excel sheet and battle mechanics> 
					-all battle calculations apply, both units will count as stationary units for the 2nd exchange
					)
		}
		
		
	Interruptable (Standard) Movement:
		(
		Unit move along determined path, if adjacent or blocked by enemy at any point, will stop and engage
		)
	Goal movement:
		(
		Will move towards specified point at all costs:
		 	~if adjacent to enemy, will take standard damage but keep moving
		 		*interruptable move units stop after attacking, goal move keeps going
		 	~if blocked by enemy, will move through, taking 2x damage
		will engage on adjacent or blocking enemies on destination.
			
		if 2 units are both using goal move (not safe goal move) and need to cross paths directly (not adjacent)
			~no damage is dealth to either unit, they pass through each other.
		)
	Safe Goal movement:
		(
		Same as goal move, but will engage rather than move through blocking units
		if both units are using no damage taken by either
		)
				
	Movement interactions: (opposing team units)
		{
		-Standard Vs Standard:
			(
			Check for units in adjacent tiles, if true, 
				then both stop and engage
			Diagonals do not count, and there is no interaction
			See exceptions if coincide on same tile at the same time
			)
		-Standard Vs Safe Goal
			(
			Check for units in adjacent tiles, if true,
				(
				Check if next turn any path blockages
					(
					if true, both units stop and engage <See battle mechanics>
					)
					else
					(
					standard movement unit stop and engage, safe goal unit takes damage and continues moving
					standard movement unit takes no damage, but does not move after engaging
					)
			)
		-Standard Vs Goal move
			(
			Check for units in adjacent tiles, if true
				(
				Standard move unit stops (no damage dealt yet until next checks made)
				Check for blockages on next move cycle
					(
					if true,
						(
						goal move 2x damage and keep moving to destination
						)
					else
						(
						goal move takes 1x damage, keep moving to destination
						)
				standard move unit takes no damage
				if goal move destination is adjacent to enemy they just passed through, see exceptions
		
		-Safe Goal Vs Safe Goal move
			(
			-Check if adjacent units, if true
				(
				check if next move cycle will cause path blockage, if true
					(
					both units stop and engage, standard battle mechanics apply
					)
				else
					(
					both units keep moving, no damage to either unit
					)
			)
			
		-Safe Goal Vs Goal move
			(
			-Check if adjacent units, if true
				(
				check if next move cycle will cause path blockage, if true
					(
					Safe Goal units stop and engage, Goal units move through, take 2x damage
					)
				else
					(
					both units keep moving, no damage to either unit
					)
			)
		
		-Goal move vs Goal move
			(
			No damage is dealt to either unit at any point except at destination when units change from moving to stationary
			Goal move units do not need to check for surrounding units, other movement types checking should cover it
			)
		}	
		


Battle mechanics:
__________________________________________________________________________________

	Order of Damage Calculation:	
		{
		if both units moving, they attack each other at the same time (both deal and recieve full damage)
		if moving unit walks into stationary enemy, moving unit deals damage first, stationary unit retaliate
		subsequent attackers <flankers> take 50% less damage from original unit <flanked>
			~in other words <flankers> take 50% less damage
			~<flankers> still do full amount of damage and attack first
			~target enemy retaliates at 50% damage after (retaliation because they are stationary)
		Archers have melee attack for when they get engaged on (current value 15dmg) in addition to their ranged shot
		}
