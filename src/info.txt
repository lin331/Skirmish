Mechanics:
	Planning Phase
		{
		Get 2 moves per planning phase, 30 seconds to plan <adjustable>
		Moves can be next turn moves, or delayed moves <So more than 2 moves can happen per turn>
		3 types of movement:
			(
			Interruptable vs goal vs safe goal <explained in execution phase>
			)
		To plan route either hold mouse down for specific path, or click end tile for shortest path
		}
	Execution Phase
		{
		Moves made in planning phase are executed
		If there is a unit at the destination of a movement, moving unit will stop on the last available square
			~will engage if enemy unit
			~will just stop if friendly unit
			~archer attack is cancelled if out of range
		
		Interruptable Move
			(
			Unit move along determined path, if adjacent or blocked by enemy at any point, will stop and engage
			)
		Goal move
			(
			Will move towards specified point at all costs:
			 	~if adjacent to enemy, will take standard damage but keep moving
			 		*interruptable move units stop after attacking, goal move keeps going
			 	~if blocked by enemy, will move through, taking 2x damage
			will engage on adjacent or blocking enemies on destination.
			
			if 2 units are both using goal move (not safe goal move) and need to cross paths directly (not adjacent)
				~no damage is dealth to either unit, they pass through each other.
			)
		Safe Goal move
			(
			Same as goal move, but will engage rather than move through blocking units
			if both units are using 
			)
			
		
		}
	Pre-Planning phase
		{
		10 seconds to view map and take in the battlefield
		}
