Need to fix:
1)Opposing Stationary units that do not move at the end of their turns while being adjacent do not damage each other in the subsequent turns

(they should damage each other once per turn when they are adjacent to each other)

2)move options get cut off at the bottom of the screen, pic: http://screencloud.net/v/p3DW
  (it currently creates the dialogue box where you let go of your click)

3)Movement mechanics, instead of having to press undo to fix a movement, should be able to just click the unit again and drag
  should also be click unit first to select it, and then drag path 2nd instead of just drag all in one go
    -can use mouse hover for pathing instead of drag if its more intuitive that way

Fixed:  
1)Goal moving around a stationary enemy unit only causes damage once 

(should be every time the units are adjacent goal mover takes damage)

2)Goal move bugs (when the destination is diagonal to enemy unit)

Things to Implement:
1) floating damage text
2) shorten time between cycles (appx 0.5 secs when no battles engaged, and add 0.25secs when damage is being done)
3) unit types
4) optimized unit placement (instead of manually imputting coordinates from terminal, should have a visual method ingame)
5) bigger grid (at least 10x17 for <standard> 10-12 units on each side battle)
6) make the entire thing bigger (size of grids/units etc)
7) unit health bars and way of matching up units to their info bar
8) line or something to mark the middle of the grid/sides (to improve map readability)
9) damage animation (maybe flashing line or something)
