1)Opposing Stationary units that do not move at the end of their turns while being adjacent do not damage each other in the subsequent turns

(they should damage each other once per turn when they are adjacent to each other)

2)move options get cut off at the bottom of the screen, pic: http://screencloud.net/v/p3DW
  (it currently creates the dialogue box where you let go of your click)
  
3)Goal moving around a stationary enemy unit only causes damage once 

(should be every time the units are adjacent goal mover takes damage)

4)Goal move bugs (when the destination is diagonal to enemy unit)

Things to Implement:
1) floating damage text
2) shorten time between cycles
3) unit types
4) optimized unit placement (instead of manually imputting coordinates from terminal, should have a visual method ingame)
5) bigger grid (at least 10x17 for <standard> 10-12 units on each side battle)
6) make the entire thing bigger (size of grids/units etc)
7) unit health bars and way of matching up units to their info bar
8) line or something to mark the middle of the grid/sides
